# Cybersecurity Career Roadmap

## Introduction

This material is intended to provide the reader with a general overview of the
cybersecurity career paths and the fundamental skills and abilities they
require. We will cover some general rules and principles that are useful in
almost all technical fields and we will briefly look at the whole
cybersecurity field to understand the different career options one might
consider, but we will mostly focus on the more engineering-oriented junior
roles.

## Cybersecurity Roles

![Cybersecurity Roles Diagram](https://github.com/hacksparr0w/cybersecurity-career-roadmap/blob/01cb6f8e30bcf02aa435ecbbea350190207c8fcd/roles.png)

The cybersecurity roles can be divided into three main categories: research,
development and administration. The research positions are oriented on
devising new cryptography algorithms, analyzing known software and hardware
vulnerabilities and coming up with new ones, or advancing the methods as well
as preventative measures of software reverse engineering. The development
positions are the sweet spot between administration and development and they
often implement tools and utilities based on recent development advancements
to solve a real-world administration problem. One example of a cybersecurity
development position might be an antivirus developer or even a security
software developer. Administration roles focus on building, running, and
monitoring information technology infrastructure in a safe and secure manner.
Research positions are often occupied by hyperfocused specialists that spend
their entire lives researching a single area or even a problem of their
interest. Research positions often require a hardcore computer science
background or a very specific area of thorough expertise. Development
positions require a generalist approach where individuals are required to be
able to solve a wide variety of problems in a broad range of environments.
Besides general knowledge of the cybersecurity landscape, development
positions also require knowledge of many programming languages and low-level
intricacies of modern operating systems. Administration positions are usually
less demanding on the theoretical and experimental capabilities of an
individual but tend to emphasize operational expertise, practical problem
solving, and deep applied knowledge of common systems and processes.
Administrators need to be very high on the trait of conscientiousness and
need to constantly update their knowledge about new tools, techniques, and
breakthroughs in their select area of expertise.

The reality of any software engineering job is that an individual is
required to basically know everything about everything and educate themselves
constantly. This is often not realistic, and a more practical approach to this
conundrum is the idea of the so-called
[T-shaped engineer][the-t-shaped-engineer]. To put it in simple terms, an
engineer should focus on one specific skill that interests him very deeply and
continuously educate himself broadly on other branches of his domain.

### Junior Roles

All these roles mentioned above share a foundation in software engineering
and computer science principles. A newcomer seeking a job in cybersecurity
should preferably decide either on an administrator or a developer position
and teach themselves the basic skills required for these positions. If one is
not able to secure a job in the field of cybersecurity itself, they still may
try to look for other junior roles in either software engineering or perhaps
network engineering, as these jobs are still very closely tied to
cybersecurity and their requirements are interchangeable.

Following is a table of skills that are deemed mandatory for junior
cybersecurity engineering roles.

            Virtually all software engineering positions require at least a
            rudimentary understanding of programming. If you are serious about
            your cybersecurity career, this is absolutely necessary. Not only
            does programming allow you to automate away a lot of the boring
            everyday taks, but it also lets you understand the tools and
            programs you depend on and allows you to build on them further. It
            also opens you the door toward understanding your operating
            system.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a cybersecurity practitioner, you don't need to understand all of
            the software architecture patterns a software development job would
            require you to, but you have to be able to solve general algorithmic
            problems and apply some common sense.

            Once you get the basic hang of programming, you should start learning
            about computer networking, since this is where the cyberattacking
            actually takes place. You should start by understanding the ISO/OSI
            model, then slowly build your way up to the most fundamental L4
            protocols, which are TCP and UDP.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to go down one of the cybersecurity administration
            roles, you should also try building your own simple network based
            on MikroTik routers and learn all about routing, switching, ARP,
            DHCP, DNS, and NAT, and try using all of these in your own toy
            networks.

When trying to master any engineering skill, remember the best way to
understand anything is to actually build it. This is also another great reason
why learning programming should be your top priority—it gives you a very
powerful tool to build and test almost anything you can imagine.

Another great tip is to get your GitHub account up and running and publish all
of your awesome coding projects and experiments there.
